# FaceRecognitionAttendanceSystem
This project was developed to emulate an attendance system that works by recognizing student's faces and matches them with their names.
The steps in the working of this project:
1. Click pictures of the students and create 128-d vector encodings of the images (handled by composite_code.py)
2. Recognize the faces using the 128-d encodings generated before (handled by face_recognition_video.py)
System requirements: Python, OpenCV, face_recognition and dlib modules.
